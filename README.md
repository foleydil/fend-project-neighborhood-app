# Neighborhood Map Project

This is the final project for Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree program. This is a React-based app, which allows a user to explore a map of local places for a given location, defaulting to 20 locations in Royal Oak, MI, which are pulled from the Foursquare API. The user can search for names or location types and results will filter accordingly. The user can also click on a location marker to view the location's photo from the Foursquare API. The Search bar can be collapsed for a larger map viewing area, which is useful on mobile screens.

## Running the App

* clone the repository to your local machine, and cd into the directory
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* in your browser, navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Requirements and Important Notes

An internet connection is _required_ to fetch location data from Fourquare. Without an internet connection there will be no location data and the app will display a blank map.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is a project for my own contribution as part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree program. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
